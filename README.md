# PWM-based-DC-Motor-Speed-Control-project
**Aims to regulate the speed of a DC motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals generated by a microcontroller, such as the LPC2148. By adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the project can precisely control the motor's speed without sacrificing torque, providing efficient and smooth operation across a wide range of speeds. This technique is widely applicable in robotics, automotive applications, and industrial machinery, where precise motor control is essential. The project encompasses both hardware design, involving circuitry for motor driving and control, and software development, focusing on PWM signal generation and user interface for speed adjustment.**
